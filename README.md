USING SMART OUTLETS

1. Plug in Arduino to computer
2. Upload the .ino sketch and take note of the port name
3. Replace "Com4" with the port name of the Arduino in main.py
4. Modulate the python_int to change dimming levels of the outlet
5. Run the python program

Progress:
I am working on making a python library for the outlets so they can be easy to use and useful for new programmers to learn about modules
